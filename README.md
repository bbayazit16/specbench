# Thanks for attending the poster session. See the slides [here](slides.pdf). See the poster [here](poster.pdf).

Slides are easy to understand and enhanced with examples! Even if you don't know anything about the topic, it should be easy to follow.

I'm Baris, an undergraduate starting my third year interested in programming languages and formal methods. This work was done under the supervision of Prof. Xujie Si during this summer (2025)!

## Project Overview

Spec\*Bench is still a work in progress. The code is provided in this repository, but there isn't yet a single docker image to set up the environment. Because Spec*Bench is in its early stages, we are iterating quickly, and most of the code is in 'quick-iteration' form (so do not judge my code!). However, the core ideas are explained well in the slides, and the code is still functional and simple to understand. If you want to try it out, install the dependencies, and run the main files (coq_main.py for Coq, and main.py for GSM+).  For Polygon, set up the environment (starth.sh in the Polygon directory - see the README.md in the Polygon directory) and run the specbench.py file.

After everything has been finalized, this repository will be updated with a proper environment and setup instructions.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions. I'd be happy to help and I'm open to collaborations!
