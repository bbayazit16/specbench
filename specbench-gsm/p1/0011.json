  "question": "{name} wants to make different sized ice cubes with {n} {unit}s of water. He can make giant cubes that use {w1} {unit}s per cube, medium cubes that use {w2} {unit}s, small cubes that use {w3} of {unit}, and tiny cubes that are half the size of small cubes. If he makes {n1} giant cubes, {n3} small cubes, {n2} medium cubes, and eight tiny cubes, how many {unit}s of water does he have left?",
