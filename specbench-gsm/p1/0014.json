  "question": "{n1} and {n2} have {t} minutes to walk to {loc1} together. It takes them {t1} minutes to get to the corner where the {loc2} is. It takes them another {t2} minutes to get to the {loc3}. It will then take {mult} times the combined amount they have spent so far to reach the {loc4}. How much longer do they have to get to {loc1} without being late, if they have already wasted {waste} minutes to get a coffee before their walk?",
