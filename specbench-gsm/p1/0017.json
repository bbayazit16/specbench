  "question": "{name} walks {n} {unit}s every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes {m} {unit}s of walking on the beach and {k} {unit}s of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, {name} walks at {mult} times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, {name}'s speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If {t} minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire {n}-{unit} walk, in minutes?",
