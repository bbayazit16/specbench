  "question": "{name} went to buy some school supplies. He bought {n1} {obj1} which cost {cur}{c1} each, {n2} {obj2} which cost {cur}{c2} each, and a rim of bond paper which cost {cur}{c3}. He also bought {n4} {obj3} which cost {cur}{c4} each. How much did {name} spend on everything if he receives {disc}% discount on all purchases?",
