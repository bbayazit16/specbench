  "question": "{name} is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the {alphabets} until she knows it. She writes it in full {n1}, writes {frac} of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. After some rest, again she re-writes everything she has written so far. How many letters has {name} written in total?",

    "`alphabets` is an integer representing the number of letters in the given alphabet"
