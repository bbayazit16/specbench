  "question": "{name} has a bag of {objects} with {n} inside. He tripped over a {obstacle} while carrying it and dropped a fraction of {frac} of them. He scrambled to search for them but only came up with {k}. When he went back home, he inspected the {objects} further. {fake_num} of them he picked up weren't {objects}, but actually {fake_object}, so he got rid of them. Seeing how upset {name} was, his father gave him a pouch of {objects} with {extra} {objects} inside. How many {objects} did {name} end up with?",
