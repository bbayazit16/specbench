  "question": "{name}'s {vehicle} breaks down. The {vehicle} weighs {weight_vehicle} {unit} and he has {item} in it weighing {weight_item} {unit}. He also has his {num_passengers} young {passenger_type} who weigh {weight_passenger} {unit} each in it. In addition, the {vehicle} comes with two spare tires, each weighing {extra} {unit}. If the force need to move the {vehicle} is {force_percent}% of the total weight, how much force does {name} need to push the {vehicle}?",
