  "question": "The biggest waterslide at {park_name} is {l1} {unit} long, and people slide down at {s1} {unit}/minute. The second biggest waterslide is {l2} {unit} long, but steeper, so people slide down at {s2} {unit}/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?",
