  "question": "{name} can run {mult_run} times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is a fraction of {frac_skip} as fast as she can run. If she can skip at {skip_speed} miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in {total_time} hours if she spends a fraction of {frac_run} of the time running, a fraction of {frac_skip} of the time skipping, and the remaining of the time walking?",
