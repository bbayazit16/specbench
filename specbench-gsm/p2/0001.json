  "question": "A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes {t} minutes to cover every {d} miles of the city. However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. If the city is {y} miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover a fraction of {frac} of the city?",
