  "question": "{n1} and {n2} have {t} minutes to walk to the {loc1} together starting from their home. It takes them {t1} minutes to get to the corner where the {loc2} is. It takes them another {t2} minutes to get to the {loc3}. When they reach the {loc3}, they remember they forgot their wallets at home, so they have to return to pick up their wallets and then walk all the way back to the {loc3} again. Once they reach the {loc3} for the second time, how much longer do they have to get to the {loc1} without being late?",
