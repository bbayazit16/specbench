  "question": "{name} is knitting winter wear for her {count} grandchildren. They're {children}, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a {c1}, {c2}, {c3}, {c4}, and {c5} for each of them. It takes {n1} skeins of wool to make a {c1}, {n2} for a {c2}, {n3} for a {c3}, {n4} for a pair of {c4}, and {n5} for a pair of {c5}. {name} wants to make two warm jackets for herself, each needing {extra} skeins of wool. Each dozen skeins of wool costs ${price}. The store has a promotion where customers receive a $20 discount on purchases over ${limit}. How much should {name} pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?",
