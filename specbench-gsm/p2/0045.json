  "question": "{name} has a flower bed that is {length} {unit_length} long. {name} wants to fill her flower bed with plants. {name}'s flowers grow {plant_width}{unit_length} wide so she needs to leave {space} {unit_length} between every plant (including the plants width). {name} already owns {owned} flowers. Each flowering plant costs {cur}{cost} at the store. However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a {cur}{disc} discount on the entire purchase. How much money will {name} spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",
