  "question": "{name} collects garbage from {n} different apartment complexes. The first {n_first} have {a} apartments each and the last one is {p}% bigger than the other {n_first} combined. However, this week, {vacant} apartments from each of the first {n_first} complexes were vacant and did not require collection service. {name} collects garbage {f} times a week from each place and he gets paid {cur}{r} per collection for each apartment. He also earns an additional 10% in tips. How much money does he make in a week?",
