  "question": "{name} is popping popcorn for a snack. As the {p} of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. {n} pop in the first {s} seconds of cooking, then {k_2} times that amount in the next {s} seconds. The kernels increase to {k_3} times the initial popping rate in the next {s} seconds, but in the final {s} seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past {s} seconds. After {name} takes the {p} off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final {s} seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does {name} have to eat?",
