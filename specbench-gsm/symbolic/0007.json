  "question": "A farmer is buying feed for his {animals}. He buys a variety of {o1}, {o2}, {o3} and {o4}. Since {o4} are a rare treat, he only buys {n4} {w4}-{unit} boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough {o3} to feed the {animals} while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys {n3} {w3}-{unit} bags. {o1} are the main diet of his {animals}, so he buys {n1} {w1}-{unit} packs. {o2} are a staple to supplement the {o1}, so he buys {n2} {w2}-{unit} sacks. If his farm truck can carry {total} {unit}s at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?",
