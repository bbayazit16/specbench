  "question": "{name}'s {vehicle} breaks down. The {vehicle} weighs {weight_vehicle} {unit} and he has {item} in it weighing {weight_item} {unit}. He also has his {num_passengers} young {passenger_type} who weigh {weight_passenger} {unit} each in it. If the force to move the {vehicle} is {force_percent}% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the {vehicle}?",
