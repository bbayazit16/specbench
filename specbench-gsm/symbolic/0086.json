She bought a {item1} for {cur}{p1}, a pair of {sport} {item2} for {cur}{p2} more than the {item1} cost, and a pair of {item3} that were originally {cur}{p3} but were on sale for a fraction of {frac} price. She had a coupon for {cur}{d} off the package of {cur}{p4} athletic {item4} that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?",
